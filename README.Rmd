The `dispositionEffect` package allows to quickly evaluate the presence of 
disposition effectâ€™s behaviors of an investor based solely on his transactions 
and the market prices of the traded assets.


## Installation

You will be able to install the released version of `dispositionEffect` from 
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dispositionEffect")
```

By the moment, you can only install the development version from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marcozanotti/dispositionEffect")
```

<!--``` {r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marcozanotti/dispositionEffect",
                         ref = "branch_name",
                         auth_token = "cf248fcfa25a81c3caea95896beb28f4e9878ff6")
```-->


## Example

The following simple example with real data shows the implemented functionalities. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(dispositionEffect)
```

Portfolio of trasactions of a real investor.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
investor %>% head()
```

Dataset of market prices of the traded assets.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
marketprices %>% head()
```

Compute realized gains, realized losses, paper gains and paper losses.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
portfolio_results <- portfolio_compute(
	portfolio_transactions = investor, 
	market_prices = marketprices, 
	allow_short = TRUE
	)
```

Summarise the behavior of the investor and plot the results to spot the presence
of the disposition effect.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

```

Since financial data may be potentially huge in size, efficiency concerns are
solved through the parallelized versions of the main functions.
