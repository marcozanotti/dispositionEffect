\usage{
disposition_effect(realized_gains, paper_gains, realized_losses, paper_losses)

disposition_difference(gains, losses)

disposition_compute(gainslosses, aggregate_fun = NULL, ...)

disposition_compute_ts(gainslosses, aggregate_fun = NULL, ...)

disposition_summary(gainslosses)

disposition_summary_ts(de_timeseries)
}
\arguments{
\item{realized_gains}{Numeric vector (or scalar) containing realized gains
values.}

\item{paper_gains}{Numeric vector (or scalar) containing paper gains
values.}

\item{realized_losses}{Numeric vector (or scalar) containing realized losses
values.}

\item{paper_losses}{Numeric vector (or scalar) containing paper losses
values.}

\item{gains}{Numeric vector (or scalar) containing gains.}

\item{losses}{Numeric vector (or scalar) containing losses.}

\item{gainslosses}{Data frame, the portfolio of the investor containing the
realized and paper gains and losses results (as those obtained via
\code{\link{portfolio_compute}}).}

\item{aggregate_fun}{Function to use to aggregate results.
Default to \code{NULL}, that is no aggregation is performed and the
results of each asset are shown.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to the aggregate function.}

\item{de_timeseries}{Data frame, the time series of disposition effects.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector (or scalar) with the value(s) of disposition
effect(s) or disposition difference(s).
A \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} is returned by ................
}
\description{
Compute the disposition effect in a vectorized way.
}
\details{
The disposition effect is defined as
\eqn{DE = (Realized Gain / (Realized Gain - Paper Gain)) -
       (Realized Loss / (Realized Loss + Paper Loss))}

The disposition difference is defined as
\eqn{DD = Realized Gain - |Realized Loss|}
or
\eqn{DD = Paper Gain - |Paper Loss|}
}
